# Resources

These notes of kind of for myself, but if anyone is seriously interested in contributing to the project, these resources might be helpful. I learned a lot looking at various existing projects and open source code.

##### Ruby Std-lib Coverage

* [Ruby Coverage docs](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/coverage/rdoc/Coverage.html)

##### Other

* [erb code coverage](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13030909/how-to-test-code-coverage-for-rails-erb-templates)
* [more erb code coverage](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/38)
* [erb syntax](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7996695/rails-erb-syntax) parse out and mark lines as important
* [ruby 2 tracer](https://github.com/brightbox/deb-ruby2.0/blob/master/lib/tracer.rb)
* [coveralls hosted code coverage tracking](https://coveralls.io/docs/ruby) currently for test coverage but might be a good partner for production coverage
* [simplecov usage example](http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/brief-introduction-to-rspec-and-simplecov-for-ruby) copy some of the syntax sugar setup for cover band
* [Jruby coverage bug](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/1196)
* [learn from oboe ruby code](https://github.com/appneta/oboe-ruby#writing-custom-instrumentation)
* [learn from stackprof](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof#readme)
* I believe there are possible ways to get even better data using the new [Ruby2 TracePoint API](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/TracePoint.html)
